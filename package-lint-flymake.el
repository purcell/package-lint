;;; Commentary:

;; Flymake is the built-in Emacs package to support on-the-fly syntax
;; checking.  This library adds support for flymake to `package-lint'.
;; It requires Emacs 26.

;; Enable it by calling `package-lint-setup-flymake' from a
;; file-visiting buffer.  To enable in all `emacs-lisp-mode' buffers:
;;
;; (add-hook 'emacs-lisp-mode-hook #'package-lint-setup-flymake)
