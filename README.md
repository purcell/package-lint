package-lint
============

This library provides a linter for the metadata in Emacs Lisp files
which are intended to be packages. You can integrate it into your
build process.

See [flycheck-package](https://github.com/purcell/flycheck-package),
which uses this code to conveniently display packaging errors while
writing elisp packages. This code was extracted from
`flycheck-package.el`. We eventually want to use it for MELPA -- it
will need to learn how to check multi-file packages, which was always
going to be out of scope for `flycheck-package`.


Installation
------------

The recommended way to get
`package-lint` is as a package from the [MELPA][melpa]
repository. The version of `package-lint` there will always be
up-to-date. There are also packages in [MELPA Stable][melpa-stable], which
track the [latest numbered tag][tags].

Usage
-----

Use the command `package-lint-current-buffer` interactively, or use
`package-lint-buffer` if linting programmatically.

If you're a package author, you can include `package-lint` in your
build process by ensuring that the package is installed, and then
using the function `package-lint-batch-and-exit` to lint your files --
see `run-tests.sh` in this repo for an example.


Roadmap
-------

Additional checks for future versions:

- WARN: header line formatting / capitalisation
- trailing line presence / formatting
- WARN: library is called *-mode but doesn't provide a major mode
- WARN: suggest cl-lib vs cl
- non-use of standard keywords
- presence of :group for each defgroup
- trailing whitespace?
- themes which aren't in a matching *-theme.el file
- use of unsafe local variables
- use of emacs version dependencies
- local variable set in header line
- (with-)eval-after-load shouldn't generally appear in packages
- using commentary to talk about load[- ]path and installation
- lack of autoloads
- references to README files which won't be bundled in a package
- use of CamelCase identifiers
- Defining a `-mode` function directly instead of using `define-derived-mode` or `define-minor-mode`
- Referring to `display-graphic-p` or `window-system` in `-theme.el` files
